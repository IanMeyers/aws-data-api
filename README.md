# AWS Data API's

AWS Data API's offer you the ability to create data oriented application API's that deliver the speed, scalability, reliability, and security of a sophisticated NOSQL platform with zero coding or configuration, and no servers to manage. In seconds, you can create a new Data API Namespace that includes strong data models, natural language search, and sophisticated data lineage tracking, presented as an HTTPS REST API.

Data API's can provide application developers with a powerful new way to build services, replacing complex back-end infrastructure of database clusters and data modelling with a simple to use, document oriented API. It also unifies your application data models with a data lake, offering native integration of your data without the need for periodic ETL processes.
